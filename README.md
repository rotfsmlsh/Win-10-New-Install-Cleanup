# Win-10-New-Install-Cleanup

UPDATE FEB 2022: This was an abandoned project. I found something else that did the job better.

This application was built in an attempt to streamline new Windows 10 installation process. Every time I do a clean install of Windows (and sometimes when I update) I end up with a handful of new pre-installed applications and a bunch of reverted privacy settings. 

My first priority was the creation of a tool to allow for easy uninstallation of pre-installed applications. As time goes on, I plan to include privacy settings and maybe even a few tools to grab commonly installed applications using a tool similar to Ninite.

Please be patient with me as I stumble through this, my primary language is Java so most of my work here is trial and error.
